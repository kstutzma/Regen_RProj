Geographic Information,"Data were collected in Summer of 2022 & 2023 in Pitch Pine Barrens on Long Island, NY, Albany, NY, Cape Cod area, MA, Ossipee area, NH, & Waterboro, ME",,,
,"Long Island: Rocky Point Pine Barren State Forest, Werthiem National Wildlife Refuge, Southaven County Park, & Hubbard County Park",,,
,Albany: Albany Pine Bush Preserve,,,
,"Cape Cod: Camp Edwards, Mashpee Wildlife Management Area, & Myles Standish State Forest",,,
,Ossipee: TNC Ossipee & Society for the Protection of New Hampshire's Forests,,,
,Waterboro: TNC Waterboro,,,
,"Stand/Unit names are used as site names, with abbreviations. E.g. 'West Branch 10' at Ossipee TNC is labled TNCO_WB10",,,

Organization of the data file,"Each site represents a treatment unit of pitch pine barren within a region. Each unit had an internal buffer of 30-40 meters and had between 18 and 25 plots located within them, with the exception of two RP D2, which was too small a unit and could only provide 9 plots with adequate buffering",,,
,"Plots were a minimum of 10 meters apart, collected on transected. Plot points were generated by use of the fishnet function in ArcGIS, snapped to a random point",,,
,Plot centers were GPS-ed using a Garmin handheld unit.,,,
,Sites that were very large were subsampled. A center point was chosen visually with uniform/representative cover. An 8 HA/20A circular buffer was added around this central point. 40 meter buffers from unit edge were enforced where necessary and plots dropped within buffers or wrong natural communities (e.g. ponds),,,
,"Sampling site data includes natural community type, soil series, treatment type, treatment year, and presence of invasive plants not captured in the regeneration and shrub/herbaceous sampling. Recorded plot data includes latitude, longitude, slope, and aspect.",,,
,Regeneration was measured in 3 size classes and plot sizes:,,,
,"Small seedling (SS), were <50cm in height and measured in 1 square meter frame, with the SW corner of the frame located at the plot center; total number, number browsed, stump sprouts, and germinates recorded",,,
,"Large seedling (LS) were >/= 50cm height and <2.5cm DBH and measured in a 10 square meter circular plot; total number, along with number browsed and stump sprouts recorded. In 2022, there was a lymantria dispar outbreak in NH, some data was recorded about LYDI dispar but it was isolated to NH",,,
,"Saplings were >/= 2.5cm and <10cm DBH and measured in a 25 square meter circular plot;  size to one decimal point was recorded for each sapling, along with information about disease/defects",,,
,"Regeneration was measured at functional height and not stretched; e.g. scrub oak branches were not pulled up to see if they exceeded 50cm, but rather measured where at their natural, effective height",,,
,"Prism data was collected at each plot, using the plot center and a 10BAF prism",,,
,"Binoculars were used the second year of sampling to look for mature, closed cones on trees. It was a rainy summer, which can contribute to cones being closed when they are not serotinous.",,,
,"Vegetation was measured at every other 1 square meter plot, with SW corner of frame at plot center. Percent cover is recorded for each species present using eight cover classes: 1 <1%; 2 1-5%; 3 6-10%; 4 11-20%; 5 21-40%; 6 41-60%; 7 61-80%; 8 81-100%. Samples were taken (or photos) for unidentified plants",,,
,"Ground cover was classified into nine type classes (i.e. lichen, trash/junk, moss, road/trail, rock, water, mineral soil, wood, & litter/duff) and abundance is characterized within the 1m² square plots, using the above eight cover classes. Water and trash/junk categories were never recorded. Litter depth measurements, measuring the depth of the O layer, were taken at the NW and SE corners of the 1m² frame at every other plot. Depths were measured up to 15cm, size of measuring tool.",,,
,Lymantria dispar outbreaks in NH in 2022 and late frost in MA in 2023 impacted the foliar abundance of some plants measured in the vegetative percent cover classes.  ,,,
,"Sampling units came in 6 different treatment catgories: Spring RxFire, Fall RxFire, Harvest, Mow & RxFire, Control, & untreated Southern Pine Beetle outbreak",,,
,"There were 3 replicates of each treatment, where possible, in each region, except for control, which had 2 replicates in every region (and 3 in LI, as it was the first summer of data collection)",,,

,"All plants were given a 4 leter species code, two from the first latin name, two from the second; all are listed on the lookups page",,,
,Data in rows are individual observations from plots within sites,,,
,"Data in columns are the species, number, size, % etc found",,,
,"Sites were no species were observed are given an NA/'no species found' designation. Data was measured, it is NOT missing, despite NAs providing some trickiness in working with R",,,
,"From data importation, data appears to be separated with a ;",,,

How data has been transformed,"Notes, LYDI defoliation, and the categories 'trash/junk' & 'water' were removed to import data into R",,,
,"Mow burn data sets are not analyzed by season, though season was first used to group the two albany datasets",,,
